## Getting the thing running
First of all you're gonna need Python 3.x and the Python package manager PIP.
Once you have these dependencies open a terminal and change into the project directory.
Run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the pip dependencies have installed run:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
Open up a browser and go to localhost:8000 and you should be good to go!
